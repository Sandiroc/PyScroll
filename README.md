# PyScroll
Designed for online web-comic, manga, or novel enthusiasts. Scrolls the page so you don't have to!  
Scrolling when reading manga is a hassle. Websites such as Viz and Crunchyroll Manga need you to keep scrolling down to get to the rest of the chapter. PyScroll scrolls the website automatically so you don't have to. Although it is primarily intended for this purpose, it can be used when reading articles or other particularly wordy websites.

# How to Use
Type in your desired scroll speed (I use a value of 15) and go to your website of choice. Shift to toggle and escape to quit.
